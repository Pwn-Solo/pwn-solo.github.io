title: About Me
---

Hi! I'm Hrishikesh Pankaj.

-----

I'm a CS undergrad from Amrita University, India. I like to work on vulnerability research, exploitation and systems security.  My journey started when I became a part of team [bi0s](https://bi0s.in/) back in 2019 during my freshman year in college. Since then, I've played numerous CTF's and developed skills in linux userspace exploitation (stack and heap) and windows kernel exploitation.
